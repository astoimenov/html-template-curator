				<p class="eg-editable">That came from—well, where does anything come from? I don’t know, but I did read a lot. When I became disenchanted with writing, I wanted to draw. I always knew that I would somehow be expressing myself, and that’s what I did, along with being a waitress once in a while. Was it a long path to sustaining yourself as an artist and writer?</p>
				<p class="eg-editable">I think I’m incredibly lucky because I had the patience and perseverance and single-mindedness to believe that I belonged in that world. It took a very long time to become an illustrator, and I had all kinds of odd jobs along the way. However, I had the good fortune to meet a man who had the same kind of philosophical outlook that I did: we were both curious and had a sense of humor, and we believed we could do whatever we wanted. For us, New York was an optimistic place. Yes, it can be a very difficult place, but we thought there was nothing we couldn’t do—it would just take time. So we found our way by working hard.</p>

				Beyoncé didn't even sing one of her own songs, and she still stole the show at the Grammy Awards. The singer, who took home two awards, belted out a soulful rendition of "Take My Hand, Precious Lord," a 1956 gospel song.

				Describe your path to what you’re doing now.
				The path started in Tel Aviv. Well, actually it started in Russia with my parents, who left their country to go to Palestine. I was born in Tel Aviv, and then my family moved to New York when I was four years old. My path was about leaving home, coming to a new place, and being an outsider. But it was also about having a good sense of self and a good feeling about the world, so New York didn’t seem too scary.

				<p class="intro eg-editable">MEET DON TILLMAN, a brilliant yet socially challenged professor of genetics, who’s decided it’s time he found a wife. And so, in the orderly, evidence-based manner with which Don approaches all things, he designs the Wife Project to find his perfect partner: a sixteen-page, scientifically valid survey to filter out the drinkers, the smokers, the late arrivers.</p>
				<p class="copy">
					<div class="article-text copy">
						<p class="eg-editable">Rosie Jarman is all these things. She also is strangely beguiling, fiery, and intelligent. And while Don quickly disqualifies her as a candidate for the Wife Project, as a DNA expert Don is particularly suited to help Rosie on her own quest: identifying her biological father. When an unlikely relationship develops as they collaborate on the Father Project, Don is forced to confront the spontaneous whirlwind that is Rosie—and the realization that, despite your best scientific efforts, you don’t find love, it finds you.</p>
						<p class="eg-editable">Arrestingly endearing and entirely unconventional, Graeme Simsion’s distinctive debut will resonate with anyone who has ever tenaciously gone after life or love in the face of great challenges. <i>The Rosie Project </i>is a rare find: a book that restores our optimism in the power of human connection.</p>

					<p class="eg-editable">Simsion won the 2012 Victorian Premier's Unpublished Manuscript Award for his book, The Rosie Project.[2][3] Text Publishing has sold the rights to the book internationally for over $1.8m.[4] The Rosie Project was published in Australia in January 2014,[5] and has since sold more than a million copies in over forty countries around the world.[6] The screenplay has been optioned to Sony Pictures Entertainment. A sequel to The Rosie Project, titled The Rosie Effect, was published on 24 September 2014 by Text Publishing.</p>

					<p class="eg-editable">Prior to writing fiction he was an information systems consultant and wrote two books and several papers about data-modelling. He established a consulting business in 1982 and sold it in 1999. At that time Simsion Bowles and Associates had over seventy staff.[7] He co-founded a wine distribution business, Pinot Now with Steven Naughton.</p>
					<p class="eg-editable">From 2002–2006, as a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne, he conducted the largest published study of data modelling practitioners (489 participants, most with substantial industry experience), to address the question 'Is data modelling better characterised as description or design?' The research included interviews with thought leaders, surveys of practitioners, and practical modelling tasks.</p>
